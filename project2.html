		<h2 class="projectTitle">Dream Nest</h2>
		<p class="bio">Dream Nest, is a magazine that I designed. It is a home-design magazine that informs and provides a service to occupiers of space in their early 20’s to mid 30’s on how to use minimalist style to create a trendy, accessible, and sustainable space. When we designed this magazine, we want to figure out what a magazine should provide rather than articles. People always read the magazines when they feel comfortable, and they want keep this motion. Therefore, I think our magazine need to make the audiences comfortable, not matter the editorial elements or visual style. I chose to follow two key words when I design the visual style: consistency and minimalism. We design our magazine cover, web home page, print version, business plan, all these things in same style. Why we do this? I remember one time in class, when our TA saw the layout of one magazine, she knew which magazine it was, and at that time, i noticed , the art direction should be a symbol of the magazine. We want, when our readers see our layout, they will know “ahh, this is Dream Nest” .  Another thing is minimalism . Why we choose minimalism, first of all, our group like it. Actually it is very important. People should like what they do, then they can do it better. On the other hand, we think, minimalism will let our audiences feel we choose articles, images, even advertising really carefully and discreetly. In that case, they will trust us; it can enhance our advertising effect and help us to build readership. In general, we want our reader would like to spend time on our magazine and it can help them to feel comfortable.</p>
