		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Introduction:</h2>
		<p class="bio">Dream Nest, is a magazine project that I worked as a designer. It is a home-design magazine that informs and provides a service to occupiers of space on how to use minimalist style to create a trendy, accessible, and sustainable space. Dream Nest focuses on home design in a fun, accessible and collaborative way. We appeal to smaller spaces for younger people in urban cities. We recognize our audience as space occupiers in a difficult real estate market whose funds are limited. </p>

		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Processing:</h2>
		<p class="bio">When we designed this magazine, we want to figure out what a magazine should provide rather than articles. People always read the magazines when they feel comfortable, and they want keep this emotion. Therefore, I think our magazine need to make the audiences feel comfortable, not matter the editorial elements or visual style.</p>

		<p class="bio">In order to achieve this goal, as the only designer of the team, I chose to follow two key words when I designed the visual style: consistency and minimalism. I design our magazine cover, web home page, print version, business plan, all these things in same style. The reason I did that is, I remember one time in class, when our TA saw the layout of one magazine, she knew which magazine it was, and at that time, i noticed , the art direction should be a symbol of the magazine. I want, when our readers see our layout, they will know “ahh, this is Dream Nest” .</p>

		<p class="bio">Another key word is minimalism. The first reason is our group like it. Actually it is very important. People should like what they do, then they can do it better. On the other hand, we think, minimalism will let our audiences feel we choose articles, images, even advertising really carefully and discreetly. In that case, they will trust us; it can enhance our advertising effect and help us to build readership. In general, we want our reader would like to spend time on our magazine and it can help them to feel comfortable.</p>
		<p class="bio">When I worked on art direction for this magazine, the biggest challenge is how to make it unique when I use minimalism visual style. It is really hard because most of minimalism products look really similar. The way I try to solve this problem is using unique colour combination and small contents to make the layout different. </p>

		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Conclusion:</h2>
		<p class="bio">Through this project, I found, the design style really need to fit the products. At beginning, my teammates thought magazine cover or layout look good but they do not think they are “ magazine style ”. I keep working in it to make the style fit our product. And then, I try to make the style unique. I just realized, I need to make our audiences think the design style and products are an integral whole, but same time, they should feel these products are different with others. I think maybe good designers should make the products normal but unique.</p>
