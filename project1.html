		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Introduction:</h2>
		<p class="bio">Pharha Quest, is a game that I worked as a level designer and programmer. This is a 2D top-down game using a third-person overhead perspective similar to older Pokemon games. Hardcore gamers will be our audiences because our combination mechanic requires the player to explore their options in completing the level by playing the game multiple times. </p>

		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Our Mechanics:</h2>
		<p class="bio">Players will be able to move around the map in all four degrees of freedom. This gives player control over where they want to explore and lets players determine the pacing of the game. As the level progresses, more security guards will roam the map. Stealth will give players a chance to hide from security guards if they get too close. This mechanic will immerse the player in the suspense of the gameplay as they wait for the security guard to pass. </p>

		<p class="bio">Players can find or create tools by combining certain items like sleeping agents, flashbangs, or acid to unlock doors. Players can learn recipes through discovering notes scattered through the levels. With this mechanic, players who enjoy exploring and wanting to master the game will be able to discover the multiple discoverable tool recipes while they play through the levels. This will enable them to strategize by using their time efficiently to find the items to create the necessary tools to save Sofia before she gets operated on. </p>



		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Processing:</h2>

		<figure class="project">

			<figcaption>The narrative line</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p class="bio">When we brainstorm the game ideas, we try to make a special 2D adventure game. To attract players, we design many cutscenes to show the narrative. I think a successful game should build its world outlook. We want the players can think they are adventuring a world, not just a game. Why is our world different? Because everyone is an unique individual; everyone has their own thought and stories. If we want players thin our game is a world, we need to try to make all NPCs have their own stories. In this project, we built a full story and add a lot of different dialogues to different NPCs. On the other hand, we added a lot of environment sounds to make it real. For example, when players walk around a sleeping guy, they can hear his snore. We thought these optional elements could make players enjoy the world and they would like to spend time on it. </p>

		</figure>
		<p class="bio">But when we program the game, cause we only have three weeks. We really do not have enough time to improve all mechanics. We have discovering and crafting mechanic, but we only have four levels, and the maps are not too big, therefore, we do not have many items allowing players to discover and craft. All of our play testers want more complex mechanics and more challenges. </p>
	
		<h2 class="sectionTitle">My Participation:</h2>
		<p class="bio">In this project, I focused on level design and programming. There are four levels and each of them has its unique map. Along the players go through the maps, more and more mechanics are introduced. In later levels, I combined different mechanics together to make more challenges. Also, I made different NPCs have their own dialogue, to add more narrative and make the game have more fun.

		<h2 class="sectionTitle">Conclusion:</h2>
		<p class="bio">Today, a lot of games are similar, so how can we make our game unique? After this project, I realized we can try to make the “ world ” unique. Due to limit of time, we cannot build a really large world, but I still want, when the players hear some NPCs’ names, they can remember their stories, they can remember some classic dialogues. I want to build a game what deserve people take time to savour, and I hope my games can make players enjoy the time when they are playing.</p>
