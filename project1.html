		<p class="bio">Pharha Quest, is a game that I worked in group. When we brainstorm the game ideas, we try to make a special 2D adventure game. To attract players, we design many cutscenes to show the narrative. I think a successful game should build its world outlook. We want the players can think they are adventuring a world, not just a game. Why is our world different? Because every one is an unique individual; everyone has their own thought and stories. If we want players thin our game is a world, we need to try to make all NPCs have their own stories. In this project, we built a full story and add a lot of different dialogues to different NPCs. </p>

		<p class="bio">On the other hand, we added a lot of environment sound to make it real. For example, when players walk around a sleeping guy, they can hear his snore. We thought these optional elements could make players enjoy the world and they would like to spend time on it. today, gameplay of all games are similar, so how can we make our game unique? I think we can try to make the “ world ” unique. Due to limit of time, we cannot build a large world, but we still want, when the players hear the name of some NPCs, they can remember their stories, they can remember some classic dialogues. I want to build a game what deserve people take time to savour, and I hope my game can make people slow down in today’s fast evolving world.</p>
