	<h1 class="name">Projects</h1>
	<p class="bio">As a student of SIAT, I worked on many projects individually or in group. Due to these projects, I have leart how to work in group, how to communicate with teammates. I enjoy working in group and I also have ability to work myself. Here are two projects I worked before.</p>

		<h2>Pharha Quest</h2>
		<p class="bio">Pharha Quest, is a game that I worked in group. When we brainstorm the game ideas, we try to make a special 2D adventure game. To attract players, we design many cutscenes to show the narrative. I think a successful game should build its world outlook. We want the players can think they are adventuring a world, not just a game. Why is our world different? Because every one is an unique individual; everyone has their own thought and stories. If we want players thin our game is a world, we need to try to make all NPCs have their own stories. In this project, we built a full story and add a lot of different dialogues to different NPCs. On the other hand, we added a lot of environment sound to make it real. For example, when players walk around a sleeping guy, they can hear his snore. We thought these optional elements could make players enjoy the world and they would like to spend time on it. today, gameplay of all games are similar, so how can we make our game unique? I think we can try to make the “ world ” unique. Due to limit of time, we cannot build a large world, but we still want, when the players hear the name of some NPCs, they can remember their stories, they can remember some classic dialogues. I want to build a game what deserve people take time to savour, and I hope my game can make people slow down in today’s fast evolving world.</p>

		<h2>Dream Nest</h2>
		<p class="bio">Dream Nest, is a magazine that I designed. It is a home-design magazine that informs and provides a service to occupiers of space in their early 20’s to mid 30’s on how to use minimalist style to create a trendy, accessible, and sustainable space. When we designed this magazine, we want to figure out what a magazine should provide rather than articles. People always read the magazines when they feel comfortable, and they want keep this motion. Therefore, I think our magazine need to make the audiences comfortable, not matter the editorial elements or visual style. I chose to follow two key words when I design the visual style: consistency and minimalism. We design our magazine cover, web home page, print version, business plan, all these things in same style. Why we do this? I remember one time in class, when our TA saw the layout of one magazine, she knew which magazine it was, and at that time, i noticed , the art direction should be a symbol of the magazine. We want, when our readers see our layout, they will know “ahh, this is Dream Nest” .  Another thing is minimalism . Why we choose minimalism, first of all, our group like it. Actually it is very important. People should like what they do, then they can do it better. On the other hand, we think, minimalism will let our audiences feel we choose articles, images, even advertising really carefully and discreetly. In that case, they will trust us; it can enhance our advertising effect and help us to build readership. In general, we want our reader would like to spend time on our magazine and it can help them to feel comfortable.</p>
