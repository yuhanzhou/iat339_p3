	<h1 class="name">Joe Zhou</h2>
	<p class="bio">born in 1995 in China, I am educated Interactive Art & Technology in Simon Fraser University. I have some basic understanding of design by learning graphic design, web design, application design and interactive system. I believe that the most important purpose of design is better user experience. I am trying to learn more design skill and knowledge in university and focus on the application design and game design. I like something that need and deserve people take time to savor. In today's fast evolving world, I want my productions can make people slow down, calm down.
