	<h1 class="name">About me</h1>
	<p class="bio">Born and raised in China, I recently moved to Vancouver to pursue an Interactive Arts and Technology degree at Simon Fraser University. I know graphic design, web design and application design well. I like designing something that need and deserve people take time to savor. In today's fast evolving world, a lot of people like "fast food", "fast game", "fast life". But still, many people want to slow down. They want to taste their food slowly, experience the games' world slowly, and enjoy their life slowly. I want to use minilism style to design something for those people, to make their life more wonderful.</p>
